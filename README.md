# PROJECT BIGFOOT

This ruby gem is a CLI application that allows the user to see Bigfoot sighting reports for the United States. Upon starting the application, the user is welcomed and then an index list of the states where there have been sightings is displayed. The user is prompted to input a corresponding number of the state for which they would like to view report data. Once the user selects a state, the 3 most recent reports are displayed. These reports include the month, year, county in which the sighting took place, the class type and a brief description of the report. An explanation of the class types is also included for the user to reference. The user is then offered the choice to view reports for another state or end the session.
